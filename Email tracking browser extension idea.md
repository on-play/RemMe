## Prompt:
10/8/2025, 1:25:49 PM

I'm tired of checking each email on my system to find out which email (google) or some other email on any website. I'm TIRED.

I want to build a browser extension, where it rememebrs which email I used (which email provider I used) for any website. 

Is the possible?



## Response:

Yes, this is absolutely possible! Browser extensions are perfect for this use case.

**What you're building:**
A browser extension that tracks and displays which email address you used to register on each website. When you visit a site, it shows you "You used john@gmail.com here" or prompts you to record it.

**Core architecture:**

1. **Storage layer** - Chrome's `chrome.storage.sync` API (syncs across devices) or `chrome.storage.local`
2. **Content script** - Runs on web pages to detect/capture email usage
3. **Popup UI** - Shows stored email for current site, lets you manually add/edit
4. **Background service worker** - Handles cross-tab logic if needed

**Data model (domain first):**
```javascript
{
  "domain": "github.com",
  "email": "john@gmail.com",
  "provider": "Google",
  "dateAdded": "2025-10-01",
  "lastVerified": "2025-10-08",
  "notes": "Work account"
}
```

**Key features you'd want:**
- Auto-detect when you're on a login page
- Quick popup showing the email for current domain
- Manual entry option
- Search across all saved email-domain mappings
- Export/import functionality

**Tech stack:**
- Manifest V3 (latest Chrome extension format)
- Vue 3 for the popup UI (works great!)
- Tailwind for styling
- IndexedDB or chrome.storage for persistence

The browser extension can monitor forms, detect email inputs, and store the domain → email mapping. You'd build it as a Vue 3 SPA for the popup interface.

Want me to sketch out the initial file structure and manifest.json to get you started?

Is there a browser extension already exists?

Based on my search, **I haven't found an existing browser extension that specifically tracks which email you used to sign up for each website**. 

The search results show:
- **Email tracking extensions** (Mailtrack, Hunter, etc.) - these track if YOUR emails were opened by recipients, not which email you used on sites
- **Password managers** (1Password, NordPass, Bitwarden, etc.) - these save passwords and can show which accounts you have, but they don't specifically focus on tracking "which email address" you used per site

The closest alternatives are:
1. **Password managers** - they store login credentials including email addresses, but you'd need to manually look them up site-by-site
2. **Searching your email inbox** - manually searching for "welcome" or "verify" emails to figure out which email you used
3. **Google/Microsoft account settings** - shows apps connected via OAuth, but not regular email registrations

**Your idea is actually filling a real gap in the market.** People genuinely struggle with this problem (the search results show tons of forum posts asking "how do I find which email I used?"), but there's no dedicated tool for it.

This validates that **building your own extension would be worthwhile**. You'd be solving a problem that thousands of people have, with no good existing solution.

## Prompt:

I want to build local only storage or something that is locally stored for privacy reasons and also not easily removable when temp or cache removed. Is that possible?



## Response:
10/8/2025, 1:28:19 PM

Yes, absolutely possible! Here are your local storage options for a Chrome extension, ranked by persistence:

## Storage Options (Best to Least Persistent)

### 1. **IndexedDB** ⭐ (Recommended)
- **Persistence**: Very high - survives cache clears
- **Capacity**: Typically 50MB+ (can request more)
- **Privacy**: Fully local, never leaves the device
- **Survives**: Cache clears, temp file deletion
- **Won't survive**: Extension uninstall, manual browser data deletion

```javascript
// Domain model first approach
const EmailRecord = {
  domain: 'github.com',
  email: 'john@gmail.com',
  provider: 'Google',
  dateAdded: new Date().toISOString(),
  lastVerified: new Date().toISOString(),
  notes: ''
};

// IndexedDB setup
const openDB = () => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const request = indexedDB.open('EmailTrackerDB', 1);
    
    request.onerror = () => reject(request.error);
    request.onsuccess = () => resolve(request.result);
    
    request.onupgradeneeded = (event) => {
      const db = event.target.result;
      const store = db.createObjectStore('emails', { keyPath: 'domain' });
      store.createIndex('email', 'email', { unique: false });
      store.createIndex('provider', 'provider', { unique: false });
    };
  });
};
```

### 2. **chrome.storage.local**
- **Persistence**: High - but can be cleared with "browsing data"
- **Capacity**: ~10MB (5MB in older Chrome versions)
- **Privacy**: Fully local
- **Survives**: Most cache clears
- **Won't survive**: "Clear browsing data" if user selects it

```javascript
// Simpler API, good for your use case
await chrome.storage.local.set({ 
  'github.com': {
    domain: 'github.com',
    email: 'john@gmail.com',
    provider: 'Google',
    dateAdded: new Date().toISOString()
  }
});

const data = await chrome.storage.local.get('github.com');
```

### 3. **chrome.storage.sync** 
- **Persistence**: High + syncs across devices
- **Capacity**: ~100KB total, ~8KB per item
- **Privacy**: Synced to Google account (encrypted in transit)
- **Trade-off**: Not fully local, but survives device changes

## My Recommendation: **Hybrid Approach**

Use **IndexedDB as primary** + **chrome.storage.local as backup**:

```javascript
// Architecture: Repository pattern
class EmailRepository {
  async save(emailRecord) {
    // Primary: IndexedDB
    await this.saveToIndexedDB(emailRecord);
    
    // Backup: chrome.storage.local
    await this.saveToStorageAPI(emailRecord);
  }
  
  async get(domain) {
    // Try IndexedDB first
    let record = await this.getFromIndexedDB(domain);
    
    // Fallback to chrome.storage.local
    if (!record) {
      record = await this.getFromStorageAPI(domain);
      // Restore to IndexedDB if found in backup
      if (record) await this.saveToIndexedDB(record);
    }
    
    return record;
  }
}
```

## Additional Protection Strategies

**1. Request persistent storage permission:**
```javascript
// In your background script
if (navigator.storage && navigator.storage.persist) {
  const isPersisted = await navigator.storage.persist();
  console.log(`Persisted storage granted: ${isPersisted}`);
}
```

**2. Export/Import functionality** (best privacy + persistence):
```javascript
// Let users backup to a local JSON file
const exportData = async () => {
  const allData = await getAllEmailRecords();
  const blob = new Blob([JSON.stringify(allData)], 
    { type: 'application/json' });
  const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
  
  chrome.downloads.download({
    url: url,
    filename: 'email-tracker-backup.json',
    saveAs: true
  });
};
```

## Privacy Benefits
- **No external servers** - everything stays on the user's machine
- **No analytics or tracking**
- **Open source** - users can verify the code
- **Export capability** - users control their data

**Bottom line**: IndexedDB is your best bet. It's designed for exactly this use case - persistent, local-only, structured data that survives normal browser operations.
